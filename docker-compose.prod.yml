# ── Production Docker Compose Override (AWS) ───────────────────────────────────
# Usage on EC2:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# This overrides the local docker-compose.yml for AWS production.
# All secrets come from /home/ec2-user/.env.prod via env_file.
# The bundled Postgres (db) service is disabled — use AWS RDS instead.

services:
  app:
    env_file:
      # On EC2, all ENV vars come from here. Plain $ is fine — docker run reads literally.
      - /home/ec2-user/.env.prod
    environment:
      # DATABASE_URL from .env.prod already points to RDS — no override needed here.
      # Keeping this section for any other docker-internal overrides if required.
      ENV: production
    restart: always # restart even after EC2 reboot (unlike unless-stopped)
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "50m" # rotate logs at 50 MB
        max-file: "5" # keep last 5 rotated files

  db:
    # Disabled in production — use AWS RDS instead of bundled Postgres.
    # Setting an impossible profile prevents this service from starting.
